## Instructions

This assignment is broken down into the following tasks:

Prepare the data.

Generate summary statistics.

Create bar charts and pie charts.

Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.

Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

Calculate correlation and regression.

Submit your final analysis.

## Files

In the *Pymaceuticals* folder are the following files:

**pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb** - This is the starting Jupyter notebook provided for the challenge.

**pymaceuticals_complete.ipynb** - This is my completed Jupyter notebook with required tables, charts, and annotations.

**mouse_bar.png** - This is a saved image of the bar plot showing timepoints for each drug regimen.

**mouse_pie** - Not a strange delicacy, but a saved image file of my pie chart showing distrubution of mice in the study by sex.

The *Data* folder contains the two data files provided for the challenge.

**Mouse_metadata.csv**

**Study_results.csv**

These two files were merged to create the data frame used in the analysis.
